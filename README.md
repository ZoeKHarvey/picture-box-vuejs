# Picture Box
_This was part of a challenge to learn a new framework and build out an app in just a few days._
Picture box is built with the Unsplash API and Vue.js to allow users a simple way to browse photos that are relevant to them. 
Just search a word (or a few) and enjoy close-to-endless results!
